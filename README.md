# cool_chook
To control chicken-coop climate based on thermal sensors and presumed time-of-year.
## Minimum Requirements
Raspberry Pi Pico-W -or- Raspberry Pi Pico with WIZNet Ethernet HAT -or- WIZNet Pico
UV LED
Relay that can power-on/-off 120VAC circuits with an activation voltage of 3.3VDC or 5VDC
Fan, 3.3-12VDC
Heat lamp, 120VAC
wire
330 Ohmm resisters
Bread-board for mounting components

## Additional/Ideal components
Access to a 3D printer (to fab weather-resistant housing(s) for components)
More fans (for a push-pull arrangement, plus any other air-circulation schemes)
More UV LED's, 4x (for varied UV availability)
Relay duplicate(s) (for individually-controlled 120VAC circuits and/or blood-sacrifices)
Solenoids and/or stepper-motors (for extra/fancy climate-control options)
